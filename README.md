#  Data Mining & Predictive Modeling Portfolio – Rohini Vishwanathan

This repository showcases my end-to-end work in data mining and predictive analytics, completed as part of a graduate-level course at Claremont Graduate University. Each project applies machine learning techniques to real-world datasets, with a strong focus on **model evaluation**, **interpretability**, and **business impact**.

 **What’s inside?**
-  Preprocessing messy data and detecting outliers
-  Building interpretable classification and clustering models
-  Evaluating models using **Accuracy**, **Lift**, and **Stability**
-  Tuning Neural Networks with Keras for optimal performance
-  Mining association rules using the **Apriori Algorithm**
-  A final ensemble project simulating real-world model selection
-  An HR attrition prediction project with full EDA and logistic regression (QBA; Data Science Intern)

Every project includes both a **Jupyter notebook** and a written **report**.


##  Reports

These PDF reports document my end-to-end learning process.

Each report includes model evaluation, parameter choices, performance summaries, and evidence of experimentation.  
**Note-** These reports reflect my hands-on learning journey and experimentation. Some early submissions may contain inaccuracies based on feedback or grading, but I’ve included them here to demonstrate transparency, growth, and technical development.

These exercises cover the full data mining pipeline—from preprocessing to classification, clustering, association rules, and performance evaluation.
